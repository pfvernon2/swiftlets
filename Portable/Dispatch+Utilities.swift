/**
 Reader Writer pattern with first-in priority semantics. Reads occur concurrently and writes serially.
 
 Execution of both read and write is based on first-in semantics of a queue. That is, all reads and writes will occur in the order in which they are added to the queue. Eventhough the reads are happening concurrenlty the queued write operations will not occur until they reach the top of the queue.

 This pattern is useful in cases where you want to access data in a fashion consistent with the order of the requests. For example a case where you wanted to update your user interface before a potentially invalidating write operation.

 If, however, you wish to ensure that writes happen as quickly as possible and/or that any data read is as current as possible, then you may want to consider using the DispatchWriterReader class. The DispatchWriterReader class ensures that reads return the most recent data based on their execution time as apposed to their queue order.

/**
 This is similar to a reader writer pattern but has write priority semantics. Reads occur concurrently and writes serially.
 
 Execution is based on write priotity at execution time rather than the first-in semantics of an operation queue. In this case all pending reads will be held off until all pending writes have completed.

 This pattern is useful in situations where race conditions at execution time must be minimized. While this may be useful, or even critical, for some operations please be aware that it can result in long delays, or even starvation, on read.
 
 - note: This object incurs significantly more overhead than the DispatchReaderWriter class. Its usefulness is likely limited to cases where it is crucial to minimize race conditions when accessing the data.

 Class representing the concept of a guard in GCD. This would typically be used where
 one must limit the number of threads accessing a resource or otherwise prevent re-entrancy.

 the semaphore to be signaled this class returns immediately with an indication of whether
 the semaphore was successfully decremented. This is useful in cases where you do not care
 to reenter an operation that is already in flight, for example.
